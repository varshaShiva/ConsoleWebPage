        <h3> Visual Studio Code is a more advanced IDE we can use for coding in JAVA Script. First you need to download the application and choose a color theme you prefer to code on. Next create a folder on your desktop named Visual Studio Code and create a folder inside the folder and name that as project 1. Then, return to Visual Studio Code and move your cursor to the top of your screen. You should see an option called file. Click that and choose open folder. Select the folder you have created for visual studio code and inside that select the folder you created for project 1. Once you see project 1 on your top left of the screen place your cursor on top of it. Click on the first icon which will create a new file and name that index.html. Once you completed all these steps and succesfully created a file start typing your html outline and began to code.  </h4>
        <h3> A console is command line that can execute simple code snippets. You can be able to view the console screen by opening your webpage with live server and right clicking on the screen. You should see multiple options, in that select the last one which should be called inspect. Then a pop up will be opened for the right side of the screen. In that pop up, select console which should be an option given on the top of the pop up. Then you will be able to view the console screen of the webpage.If you wish to print something on the console screen, simply use the code "console.log()". Enter what you would like to see in the console screen inbetween the curvy brackets. If it is a string use double qoutes before it and if it is a variable type that variable name directly inside the brackets.</h3>
